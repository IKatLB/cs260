	2.1 - we will need both cout and cin in order to handle inputs and printing to terminal.
we will also need an enqueue and dequeue function in order to add and remove to the head/tail. 
As well as a peek function in order to see the head of the queue. and then maybe functions to see if the queue
is full or empty.

	2.2 - we will need to know the number of elements in our queue, as well as the actual values of
each of those elements. And we will need to know the maximum number of elements in our queue if there is a limit.

	3.1 - we will need the same cout and cin as well as a peek function however our peek function will also
need an index in order to know which element we want to peek at. we will also need a remove function with an index
input, and an add function with an input. 

	3.2 - we will need to be able to know the values of each of the elements, the length of the list, the max
length of the list, and the index value we are interested in.
