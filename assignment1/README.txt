In this program marbles are represented by the current_bag variable and are displayed in the terinal as a number.
marbles are added and removed by typing either a positive or negative number in the terminal.
some ways this program could be tested is by inputting values and getting expected results. For example I input 50 and made sure that 50 was then displayed as the updated value.
I then input -50 and made sure that 0 was then the displayed value.
